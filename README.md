There are two submissions in this repository:

1. Extracting Questions from Files/Text

This problem was solved using two steps:
	a. Building a Custom NER to extract the questions into text (extracting_questions/extracting_questions.ipynb)
	b. Classifying the questions extracted into a multi label classification format (extracting_questions/MultiLabelClassification.ipynb)

2. The python programming Challenge was solved in: python_assignment.py

While I have tried my best to document my submission well, If I have missed out anywhere:
Please do feel free to contact me in case of any questions/issues you might face while running them.

Thanking You.
